<h3>Weather Wonder in Asp.NET/Visual Basic</h3>
<p> This project was originally created for a probability and statistics class at SUNY New Paltz by Andrew Haaland.  He has modified the project to now be run entirely by Asp.NET and Visual Basic from PHP.
This project currently uses the WeatherUnderground.com API, and will soon work with the National Weather Service API that uses XML and/or WSDL</p>
